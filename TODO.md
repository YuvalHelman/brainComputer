### What do I want to learn?
I want to practice my programming skills on a real problem. a web application.
This Web Application will be a nice place to try out various things.
- For each new feature, I would want to dive into the Theory to understand the 
  underlying constructs, and then implement something basic in my app.

- An authentication service for users 
    - learn how authentication works. how does it related to cryptography?
    - read about authentication mechanisms in applications.
    - Decide what to implement in terms of authentication, or another cryptography construct.
    - implement BASIC authentication in my application.
  about practical cryptography)
- Make the website live with a Domain

- The application could be about something I connect to:
  Music  \ Finance  \ Blogs

### TODO List:
- Set up application environment and blank website.
    - Copy from other web-app
    - setup basic docker env with a mongo or something
- Set up a basic password authentication mechanism in the website with a DB involved.
- Find out how to implement your own authentication algorithm.
- Deploy the application to a domain.




### Why should I enjoy this project?
well... 
### how this skill will make me more marketable?
